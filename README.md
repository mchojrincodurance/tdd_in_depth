# ATM Simulator

This Repository contains the project you'll be working on through [TDD in depth course]([url](https://codurance.moodlecloud.com/course/view.php?id=24)https://codurance.moodlecloud.com/course/view.php?id=24).

This application is designed to simulate the working of a real ATM (Automatic Teller Machine). As you move along the course you'll be:

* Adding Unit Tests
* Adding Acceptance Tests
* Improve the existing codebase by applying good coding practices
* Build new features using advanced TDD techniques

Among others.

Fork this repository, if you haven't already, explore the code, set up your development environment and make it run. You are going to be seeing it quite a bit.
